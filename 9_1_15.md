- Meeting in room 137
- Homework posted for Monday

# Biomes

### Elevation

As you go 1000 ft in elevation, the temperature of the atmosphere generally drops 3 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Rain shadow effect

Warm ocean on left side of the ocean with prevailing winds picks up moisture which causes rain when they hit a mountain and are forced up. When the air goes up over the top of the mountain and starts going down, the dry air warms up and picks up moisture from the soil and causes an arid area.

Rain shadow effect is really determined by which side of the prevailing winds you are on.

### Soil type

Alters plant communities, not climate.

### Aspect

Aspect is what direction any given slope is facing.

In the example picture the sun hits the south side of the slope more often and dries it out more quickly.

North facing slopes hold moisture a little bit better.

## Summary

- Climate vs. Weather
- Physical template defines biotic community
- (go back to slides for the rest)

## Survey of Biomes

### Tropical Rainforests

- Right along the equater
- Equatorial

### Tropical Seasonal Forests/Savannas

- Think Lion King
- Just north and south of the equator
- Lots of grasses
- Dispursed trees

### Hot Deserts

- Deserts are defined by lack of presipitation
- Think of Road Runner/Egypt

### Temperate Grasslands

- Further north and south (that's about where we are)
- Nebraska/Kansas
- Bison

### Temperate Shrublands and Woodlands (Chaparral)

- Little bit patchy
- Seasonal (temperate = warm/cold seasons)
- Most of the precipitation comes in fall/window
- Sometimes called mediterranian climate
- Parts of the Great Basin
- Same plant communities in the mediterranian that we see in the US southwest
- California/Utah area

### Temperate Deciduous Forest

- Eastern part of the US from Illinoisish area
- Changing leaves in fall
- Vermont in the fall

### Temperate Evergreen Forest

- Pacific coast, Oregon coast/Seattle area
- Very thick/lush vegetation but tends to be Evergreens
- Driven by the moderating nature of the coast


### Boreal Forest

- Forest area very far north (top of Canada, Europe, China, Russia -- not quite up to Greeland yet but present in Iceland)
- Lots of snow

### Tundra

- Under snow or ice
- When they do thaw out the growing season is short
- Not a lot of moisture

### Aquatic Biomes

- Think about the different depths

## QUestions

- What stressors do organisms living on those landscapes face?
- How do organisms cope with those stressors?
