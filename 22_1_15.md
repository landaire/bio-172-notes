## Patterns vs Process

Evolutionary **paterns are empirical observations** from a variety of disciplines

Evolutionary **processes are the mechanisms** that produce the observed patterns.

### Aristotle

- **Scala naturae**
- Hierarchy determined by God
- Organisms occur at a fixed rung

### Early ideas about relationships among living things

"The Creator **designed** each organism for a specific purpose"

Carolus Linnaeus:

- Suggested a nested classification system
- Similarities reflect pattern of their creation
- Each species still assumed to be **fixed**

Cuvier and Hutton noticed change over time with layers of sediment and crap.

Lyell:

- Took Hutton's idea to suggest mechanisms of geologic change are consistent over time
- Earth must be older than a few thousand years.

Malthus:

- There is a competition for finite resources with winners and losers

Erasmus Darwin:

- Suggested species change

Lamark:

- Inheritance of acquired characteristics. Organisms strive to become more complex.

### Adaptations

- Inherited characteristics that increase an organism's probability of surviving and reproducing.
