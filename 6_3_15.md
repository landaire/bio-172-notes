# Fungi

## Fungal body structure

Multicellular filament form

- Body composed of filaments called **hyphae**
	- Tabular cell walls (including **chitin**), plus cell membrane
	- Can be divided by cell walls called septa, or not
		- Eell walls dividing = **Septate hypha**
		- No cell walls dividing = **Coenocytic hypha**
- Multicellular filament form
	- Fruiting body (**Sporocarp**)
- **Single cell body form = yeast**
	- **Chitin** (structural polysaccharide also found in arthropods)
- Characterized by rapid division called budding
- Hyphae do not penetrate host/food cells.
- Two modes of absorpotion
	- Intracellular absorption
		- Enzymes secreted to allow **hyphal penetration of host/food cell membranes**
		- Haustoria
	- Mycorrphizal fungi
		- Symbiotic with plants (roots)
		- Exchange phosphate and other ions for carbohydrates

## Fungal life cycles and reproduction

- Propagate via **spores** which can be produced either asexually or sexually.
- Spores will germinate if food and moisture available
- Germinated spores produce mycelia

- Sexual:
	- Signaling pheromones
		- Hyphae grow toward each other
		- Hyphae fuse (plasmogamy)
		- Union of cytoplasm from two mycelia
	- Heterokaryotic
		- Cytoplasm fused, but nuclei separate
	- Karyogami
		- Fusion of heterokaryotic
