# Exam

1. Which of the following is in the correct order from least to most complex?  
population, individual, community, biospere, ecosystem

5. Rabbits and cats eat their own fecal material. Why?  
As herbivores they maximize nutrient uptake from difficult to digest plant material

6. Roots  
Roots are deep, so there's little rainfall and soils that erode easily.

7. Approximately 2000 carrot seeds will fit in one teaspoon.  
They are r-selected species

8. Darwin was a giant tortoise eater, why did the tortoises survive?  
Generally low metabolic rate of ectotherms

9. "Drink like a fish" is misleading. Why?  
Marine fish drink large amounts


# Regular Notes

How do we quantitatively detect the evolutionary patterns associated with the processes we have discussed?

- We start with a model that assumes the population is not evolving
- Hardy-Weinberg Proportions
	- (H-W equilibrium, H-W principle)
	- Assumptions
		- No natural selection
		- The population is infinitely large
		- There is no mutation
		- No migration
		- Mating is at random

If a population is in H-W proportions, there is no evolution occurring. If we have two alleles at frequences p and q, the frequencies of each are equal and p + q = 1

Where do those equations come from?

- Two rules in Probability:
	1. Sum rule: when two events are mutually exclusive, the probability that **A or B** will occur is the sum of the probability of each event
	2. Product Rule: The probability of two independent events BOTH occurring (A and B) is the product of the probabilities of each event.
