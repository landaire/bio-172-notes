Sponage anatomy:

- Bag of cells
- No clearly defined head/tail end

Evidence Supporting the Theory of Evolution:

- Artificial Selection
- Fossil record
- Homology
- Direct Observation

These are all **patterns**

## Processes

- Natural Selection
- Mutation
- Migration
- Non-random mating
- Infinite population size

### Mutation

Variation occurs from gene mutation.

### Migration

- **Increases** genetic **variation** *within* populations
- **Decreases** genetic **differentiation** *among* populations

### Non-random mating

Usually leads to an excess of genotypes associated with preferring mating types. Birds dancing and shit.
