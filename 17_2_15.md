Taxonomy: Naming things.

## Evolution of early life

- Simple cells evolved via:

1. Abiotic synthesis of organic molecules
2. Formation of macromolecules
3. Formation of protocells
4. Self-replicating molecules

**Urey-Miller experiment**: Constructed a closed environment (series of glass balls and tubes that were sealed/closed from the env) and in those they manipulated the components to mimic the early environment, and applied a spark. They got a crapload of amino acids.

## Key events in history of life

- Evolution of eukaryotes
- **Endosymbiosis** (one organism living inside another to the mutual benefit of both) (first proposed by Lynn Margulis)
- Unicellular organism engulfs another cell
- Evidence?
	- Similar endosymbiotic relationships exist today
	- Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain circular DNA
	- Extant species of bacteria similar
	- Mitochondria and chlorplasts reproduce via binary fision
	- Double membrane
