# Evolution stuff vol.2

## Fossil Record

### Law of succession

As you go back in time and dig further down you see fossils that differ more substantially

### Transitional Forms

Forms that have intermediate characteristics between two different lineages.

## Homology

Definition: Similarity in characteristic resulting from a shared ancestry.

Versus **analogous**: similar due to similar selective pressures.

### Vestigial structures

Remnants of bones they used to have (whales and their pelvic bone or some shit idk)

### Tree diagrams

#### Monophyletic groups

Groups that include a common ancestor and all derived taxa

## Final evidence: direct observation
