**Frequency-dependent selection**

- Certain phenotypes are favored dependin gon how common or uncommon they are
- Negative frequency-dependent selection
- Rare phenotypes are favored by selection

**Oscillating selection**

- In variable environments, different phenotypes will be favored at different times
- Frequencies change with environment

### Selection on traits (multi-gene):

- **Most traits are affected by more than one gene**
- Phenotype = Genotype + Environment

### Sexual Selection

Two categories of sexual selection:

1. Intrasexual selection
	- Selection within the same sex
	- Individuals of one sex compete directly with other members of the same sex for mates

2. Intersexual selection
