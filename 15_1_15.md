# Environmental Stresstors (cont.)

We talked about:

- Thermoregulation (responding to temp.)
- Water Balance

## Nutrients

### Herbivores

- Grazers
	- Leafy material/grasses
- Browsers
	- Woody material
- Granivores
	- Seeds
- Frugivores


#### Herbivorous Diets

- high in cellulose
- rich in carbon
- low in protein
- most carbohydrates locked in indigestible cellulose

Digestion in **ruminants** (multiple stomachs):

Symbiotic bacteria & protozoans:

- digest cellulose

Ruminant animal:

- Delivers cellulose
- Regulates pH & chemistry

Ruminants also increase **mechanical breakdown** of plant material by chewing their cuds. More surface area.

**Non-ruminant herbivores**:

- **Grazing marsupials**
- Ruminant-like
- Stomach not divided but has regional specificity
- **PARALLEL EVOLUTION**
- **Coprophagy**: eating fecal matter

#### Carnivores

Major limitation: food availability

First-level carnivores eat herbivores.  
Second-level carinvores eat 1st-level carnivores

#### Summary

Nutrient Acquisition: Remember, **prey are not willing participants**, prey items have a variety of defense mechanisms to avoid predation
