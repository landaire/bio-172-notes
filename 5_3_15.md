# Angiosperm

## Monocots

- One embryonic leaf (cotelydon)

Monocots are pretty round, whereas dicots are more eliptical.

**First group that has vascular tissues**: FERNS

- Veins usually run parallel
- Root sysem usually fibrous
- Flower parts in multiples of 3.

## Eudicots

- Two embryonic leaves
- Ring of vascular tissue
- Veins net-like
- Taproot (similar to carrots)
- Flower parts in multiples of 4 or 5

## Review

Monocot/Eudicot:

- Embryos: 1/2 cotyledon
- Leaf venation: parallel/net-like
- Stems: scattered/rings
- Roots: fibrous/taproots
- Pollen: one grain/\<didn't get this one\>
- Flower parts: 3/4,5

# Fungi

## Ecological significance

- Decomposers
- Parasites and pathogens
	- Use enzymes to penetrate host cells for nutrients
	- e.g. athlete's foot
- Mutualists
	- Live in or with another organism and provide organisms with nutrients
- Fungi absorb nutrients digested by enzymes
	- Body structure adapted for absorption
		- Think *surface area*
	- Two most common body structures
		- Multicelluar and single cells
