# H-W Math

p = A\_1  
q = A\_2

If p = 0.8 and q = 0.2:

A\_1 A\_1 = p^2 = 0.64  
A\_1 A\_2 2pq = 0.32  
A\_2 A\_2 = q^2 = 0.04  

## H-W 100 Wombats

Genotype/Number of Individuals

100/100 55  
100/120 12  
120/120 33

### Steps

1. Define terms  
p = freq. 100  
q = freq. 120

2. Identify number of observed genotypes  
A\_1 A\_1 = 55  
A\_1 A\_2 = 12  
A\_2 A\_2 = 33

3. Calculate allele frequencies
A\_1 = 122  
A\_2 = 88  
Prob. of A\_1 = 122/200 = .61  
Prob. of A\_2 = 88/200 = .39  
p + q = 1

4. Calculate expected genotypic frequencies  
p = 0.61, q = 0.39  
Expected Freq:  
A\_1 A\_1 = p^2 = (.61)^2 = 0.372  
A\_1 A\_2 = 2pq - 2(.61)(.39) = 0.4758  
A\_2 A\_2 = q^2 = (.39)^2 = 0.152  
0.372 + 0.4758 + 0.152 = 1

5. Calculate expected number of individuals  
Multiply everything by 100.  
100 * .372 = 37.2  
100 * .4758 = 47.6  
100 * .152 = 15.2

6. Compare expected and observeed values  
37.2 -> 55  
47.6 -> 12  
15.2 -> 33

x^2 = (SIGMA)((OBS - EXP)^2) / EXP)

In this case, the result is 55.9. Compare to 3.841. Calc value > 3.841 doesn't conform to H-W expectations or calc value < 3.841 conforms. Again, in this case, this does not compare.
