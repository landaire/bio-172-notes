# Evolution and Speciation

Adaptive Raditations can only occur when there are a wide variety of empty **niches** to be filled by the newly diverging organisms.

**Gradualism or Punctuated Equilibrium?** Yes! Evolution happens with both.

How are evolution and speciation related?

- Rule of thumb:
	- If the allelic change results in a physical or physiological change directly tied to an important reproductive trait, speciation can occur quickly.

Ovals with feet from slide:

Morphological species concept: things look alike.  
Phylogenetic concept: find a common ancestor. All share a common ancestor, so you could group together all of them.  
Biological concept: they just need to be together
