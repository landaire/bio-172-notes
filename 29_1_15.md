Processes that lead to evolutionary patterns:

- Mutation
- Migration
- Non-random mating
- Natural selection
- Genetic drift

**Genetic drift**:

Random changes in allele frequencies due to non-infinite population size

Canc ause increase in alleles that decrease fitness (as in captive breeding)

**Founder/Bottleneck Effect**:

Low number of individuals establish a population

## Questions

**Fitness**:

Ability to survive and reproduce

**Hadley Cells**:

Higher solar energy transfer at the equator, whereas at the poles light is hitting as an angle. Sets up a situation where the earth's surface heats up more at the equator, air starts rising, picks up moisture, rises into the atmosphere, air is cooling, water condensing, air cell hits the uper atomosphere bends towards the poles in both directions, descends back to the surface of the earth, cell starts rotating just north and south of the equator and is considered a Hadley Cell.
