Gram stains:

- Cell walls of the two different types of bacteria are different. One bacteria will take up the stain, the other won't

Bacteria can really easily exchange genetic material through **horizontal gene transfer**, which is the exchange of a genetic material across branches of an evolutionary tree.

## Single-celled eukaryotes

Red, brown, green alga

### **Nutrient Acquisition**

- Autotrophs - commonly called algae
	- Use photo or chemical energy to produce organic molecules
- Heterotrophs
	- Obtain energy by eating other organisms or substances derived from other organisms
- Mixotrophs
	- Have a flagellium

**Diatoms**: Enclosed within a cell wall made of silica.
