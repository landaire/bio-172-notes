## Plants -- water uptake

- Take in water through roots
- Some plants go very deep and narrow
- Some spread out horizontally
- Cacti have roots which spread out horizontally to absorb more water when it *does* rain, and it also helps with structural support

### Leaves

Balance increase surface area for photosynthesis but also need to regulate water loss

### Stems, limbs, and shoots (storage)

Roots to uptake water when it's available, something to store water when they do get it, and leaves will be minimized to reduce loss of water (this is in the context of cacti?)

Strong interaction between **thermal balance** and **water balance** in plants.

## Water Balance in Animals

- Consuption of liquids
- Secretion of waste

Look at a desert animal like a Kangaroo Rat. They produce relatively little urine, have the ability to withstand levels of waste product in that urine, get most of their water in their diet. Can metabolise fat reserves and get water metabolically as well.

Marine fish drink salt water, get thirstier, drink more salt water, but pump the salt out of their body.

## Nutrients

### Plant perspective

- Light (which is really the driver of nature)
- Water
- Soil

C3 plants lose more water because their stomata are open all of the time  
C4 plants require more energy
CAM plants are better in hot climates since water is minimized, but requires more energy and slow plant growth

**TODO**: Soil type (know soil type and roots)

### Nutrient uptake, animals

**Herbivores**: Plant eaters like bison, caterpillars, some fish (suckers)

**Carinovres**: Meat eaters like lions, snakes, sharks, birds of prey, spiders
