# Hierarchial Structure of Biological Systems
----

**Ecology**:  The study of the **relationship** between an organism and its **environment**.

**Biosphere**: All systems together (snow, living stuff, cells, tissue, organs, organisms, etc.)

- Ecosystems (interacting species + abiotic)
- Communities (multiple interacting species)
- Metapopulations, Populations, Demes (groups of single species individuals)

**Metapopulation**: A population broken into sets of sub-populations (or demes) held together by dispersal or movements of individuals among them.

**Community**: All populations of different species living and interacting within th same area.

**Ecosystems**: All organisms within a community and the abiotic factors in their environment

- Energy flows through ecosystems
- Nutrients cycle

# Physical Environment
----

**Climate**: long-term description of weather, based on averages and variation measured over decades.

**Weather**: current temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and cloudiness.

*Climate* determines where and how organisms live across the course of their lives, *weather* influences an organism's behavior across the course of a day.

***Global energy balance and differential delivery of solar energy across the planet*** drives the climate system
