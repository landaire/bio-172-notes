Mechanism proposed by Wallace and Darwin:

- Natural Selection

### Natural selection as we currently understand it

- Observation 1: Individuals within a population **vary in inherited traits**
- Observation 2: All species may produce more offspring than their environment can support. **Some offspring will not survive**

### Points to remember

- Natural selection and evolution are not synonymous: Natural selection is **one** mechanism that can lead to evolution.
- Evolution does NOT act "for the good of the species." Evolution increases the **fitness** of the INDIVIDUAL organisms best suited to their environment
