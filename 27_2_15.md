# Evolution of Plants

## Seedless non-vascular plants

- "Bryophytes"
- No vascular tissue or true roots
- Moist environment required for reproduction
- Gemtophyte dominant
- Three phyla

## Hepatophyta

- Phylum Hepatophyta = liverworts
	- Most "primitive"
	- Growth is horizontal
	- Pores on upper surface thalli
		- Gas exchange
	- One-celled rhizoids on lower surface
		- Anchor plant to substrate
	- Sexual and asexual reproduction

### Two groups:

1. Thalloid liverworts
2. Leafy liverworts

## Anthocerophyta

- Phylum Anthocerophyta = hornworts

## Bryophyta

- Phylum Bryophyta = mosses
	- Blades of leaves on cell thick
	- Multicellular rhizoids on underside of leaves near substrate

# Vascular plants

- Sporophyte dominant
- Transport of water and nutrients
	- via **xylem** and **phloem**
- Roots
- Leaves
- Sporophylls 

## Seedless vascular plants

- **Ferns** and allies
- True vascular tissue and leaves
- Sphorophyte dominant
- Free-living gametophyte
- Micophylls or megaphylls (suffix phyl = leaves)
- Two phyla

### 1. Lycophyta

- Club mosses, spike mosses, quillworts
- Most ancient vascular plants
- Microphylls

# Notes

Know difference between liverwort, hornwort, or moss based off of name
