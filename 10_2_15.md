## Modes of speciation

**Allopatric Speciation** - Geographic division causing speciation

**Sympatric speciation** - Occurs in populations in same geographic region

**Polyploidy** - A mistake during DNA replication results in extra sets of chromosomes

**Sexual selection** - Subpopulations could have different genetic traits that are selected by different genetic types of females, resulting in non-random mating


## Rates and patterns of speciation and evolution

Look at question 20 on his sample exam.

**Microevolution**: Evolutionary changes below the species level; change in allele frequency in a population over generations.

**Macroevolution**:  Evolutionary changes above the species level; speciation, extinctions, mass extinctions. This primarily relates to changes in the environmen

**Gradualism**: Slight changes over time

**Punctuated Equilibrium**: No change for a long time, then suddenly a burst of change
