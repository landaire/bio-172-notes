### Organismal Response to their Environment


**Stressors**:

- Temperature (shelter)
- Water
- Energy & Nutrients (food)

### Aquatic Organisms:

- Oxygen levels

## Response to Changes in Temperature

#### Ectotherms

Regulates body temperature using energy exchange from external environment. Think reptiles, fish in tropical water.

#### Heterotherms

Exhibit both endothermy and ectothermy. Tunas, bats, some sharks. At night allow their body temp to decrease. They are able to warm the important parts of their body though.

#### Endotherms

Regulates body temperature through metabolic heat generation. Things like us, birds, mammals.

**Advantages**:

- Can be active throughout the day
- Can exist in cold areas

**Disadvantages**:
- Need food

**Notes**:

Store energy at night to avoid starving to death. Small animals have high surface area, low volume, so a lot of energy goes into maintaining body temp.

#### Other notes
Ambient temp vs. body temp for an endotherm:

Pretty constant. Body temp stays pretty much the same between 0-50 ambient temp.

For an ectotherm, graph starts at 0, goes up and up and up until around 50 then at 50 it goes down because they die.

## Water Balance

### Organismal Level:

++ Uptake  
-- Loss

Drink when thirsty -> excretion  
Absorption -> transpiration (plant context absorption happens in roots, transpiration happens in leaves)
