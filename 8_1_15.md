### Global Atmospheric Circulation Patterns

**Hadley cell**: Airflow from the equator going back to the surface at about 30' north and south, then heading back toward the equator (think of a circlular diagram). Deserts are at about 30' north and 30' south because of the dry air.

**Ferrell cell**: Similar to the Hadley cell, but the warm air does not recirculate and goes from about 30' to 60'.

**Polar cell**: Only cold, dense air circulating from 60' to 90'.

Precipitation map of the US is rotated 90' (moving horizontally) in comparison to annual temperature (which moves vertically)

#### Facors determining the physical environment at a finer scale:

- Position relative to the ocean currents
- Elevation
- Rain shadow effect
- Soil type (geology)
- Aspect
