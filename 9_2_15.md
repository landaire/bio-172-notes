## Species Concepts

- Morphological species concept
	- Considered members of the same specis if anatomically (morphologically) identical
	- Benefits:
		- Can be used on fossils
		- Can be used for both sexual and asexual species
	- Drawbacks:
		- Subjective (my opinion may not agree with you ropinion)
			- E.g. several anatmoical characteristics are identical, but some are not. Is it enough to constitute a species?
- Ecological species concept
	- Considered members of the same species if the use of habitat and other resources is the same
	- Benefits:
		- Can be used for both sexual and asexual species
		- Emphasizes the role of natural selection in speciation
	- Drawbacks:
		- Subjective
- Phylogenetic species concept (more modern)
	- Considered members of the same species if they are the smallest set of organisms that all share a common ancestor not shared by other similar organisms
	- Benefits:
		- Can be used for both sexual and asexual species
		- Emphasizes the role of evolution in speciation
	- Drawbacks:
		- Expensive
		- Remains someone subjective
- Biological species concept (most frequently used)
	- Considered members of a species if all members have the **potential to interbreed in nature** and produce viable, fertile offspring
	- Benefits:
		- Relatively simple and straightforward
		- Relies on the concept of evolution of reproductive isolation
	- Drawbacks:
		- Doesn't apply to asexual species, fossils
		- Some grey area with closely related groups (situations where organisms are separated and have no opportunity to reproduce, but if you bring them together then biologically they can)
		- Hybrids

## Reproductive Isolation

- The existence of biological **factors (or barriers) that impede members of two species from producing viable, fertile offspring
- Two categories of barriers
	- Prezygotic (hinder fertilization)
	- Postzygotic (vaible, fertile offspring)

- Prezygotic barriers
	- "before the zygote"
	- Prior to fertilization  
	A. Prevent mating attempt
		- Temporal isolation
		- Behavioral isolation (dancing and crap)
- Postzygotic barriers
	- "after the zygote"  

	A. **Reduced viability**  
		- Lower survival of hybrids

	B. Reduced fertility  
		- Hybrid sterility

	B. Hybrid Breakdown  
		- Offspring of F1 generation feeble or sterile  
		- Example: rice

## Modes of speciation

- Assume BSC as species definition
	- Relies on **reproductive isolation**
	- **Gene flow is interrupted**

1. Allopatric speciation
	- "allo" = "other, "patric" = homeland
	- Occurs when a population is divided into geographically isolated subpopulations
	- Physical (not biological) separation of populations
2. Sympatric speciation
	- How does it occur?
		- Habitat differentiation
			- Genetic variation allows a subset of the population to exploit a different resource or habitat than the parent population
