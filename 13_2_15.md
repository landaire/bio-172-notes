# Some random species shit

**Taxonomy**: Grouping things by similar traits

**Phylogeny**: The evolutionary history of a species or group

- Which species are closely related

Interpreting phylogenetic trees:

- A **hypothesis** about evolutionary relationships
- Each branch represents the divergence of two evolutionary lineages from a common ancestor

## Domains

- Revision placed all **prokaryotes** in one kingdom (Monera) - prokaryote = no membrane enclosed nucleus or organelles
- Idea of PLANTS - ANIMALS & MONERA not supported by genetic data (1977)

Three domains:

- Bacteria
	- Prokaryotic
	- Cell walls contain peptidoglycan
	- 1 type of RNA polymerase
	- Have not been recorded to grow above 100ÂºC
- Archaea
	- Prokaryotic
	- Cell walls do not contain peptidoglycan
	- > 1 type of polymerase
	- Are not killed by most antibioics
	- Origianlly discovered in exterme environments
- Eukaraya
	- Membrane-bound nucleus and organelles
	- May or may not have cell walls
	- > 1 type of RNA polymerase
	- No circular chromosomes

## Evolution of early life

- Sipmle cells evolved via:

1. Abiotic synthesis of organic molecules
2. Formation of macromolecules
3. Formation of protocells
4. Self-replicating molecules
