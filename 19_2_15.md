# Pre-exam

- Abioitic synthesis and something else  
- Self-replication  
- 3.4-3.9 million years ago for first fossils we have seen

Origin of organelles: endosymbiosis

## Evidence supporting origin of organelles

- Similar bacterial pairs currently
- DNA of MT/CP -> circular
- MT/CP - divide by binary fision
- Double membrane surrounding thos organelles

Mass extension usually results in new critters to appear

# Review

Polyploidy: Complete extra set of all chromosomes  
Triploid: 3 sets  
Tetraploid: 4 sets  
Autopolyploid - All chromosomes from one species

Henry-Weinberg:

p = (2xA1A1)+A1A2 / 2x individuals

Genotypic frequencies: A1A1 = p^2  
A1A2 = 2pq  
A2A2 = q^2

EXP #:

(.25*100) = ... 

Expected and observed are exactly the same
