# Populations

> What it all boils down to is: What's the difference between the birth rate and the death rate?

`birth rate - death rate = intristic rate of increase`

## Factors influencing population growth

- Population Size (N)
- Sex ratio
- age structure
- reproductive output
- disease
- migration
- probability of survival
- etc.

## Quantititative Description of Populations

- Initial size
- Birth rate
- Death rate
- Resource limitation (what is the limiting resource? food? water?)

**Demography**:

- Statistical study of group properties of populations
- Size
- Age distribution
- Sex ratio
- And all changes in all of the above

## Modeling quantitiatively

`r` will reflect the intristic rate of increase. `dN/dT = rN`, `r = 0.1`.

**Note**: `lambda` is the rate of increase in from one time step to the next, often one year. `r` is the rat eof increase over very small time intervals.

Actual graph will have a bell curve, and the maximum is `K`, the carrying capacity.

`dN/dt = rN{(K-N)/K}`, where `(K-N)/K` is the proportion of resources remaining.

For humans, `r =~ 0.03`.

Use input settings:

- Model type: continuous
- Plot type: N vs R
- r: 0.03
- Pop size: 7
- Run time: 5
