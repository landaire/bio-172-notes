# Bio Review

## Exam 1

- Least to most complex:
	- Individual, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere
- Evolution is best defined as changein allele frequency over time
- Rabbits eat their own fecal matter:
	- As herbivores they maximize nutrient uptake from difficult to digest plant material
- Deep root systems are a sign of periods of little rainfall and soils that erode easily
- **Ect**otherm: dependent on **ext**ernal sources of heat (usually have slow metabolic rate as a result)
- Endotherm: maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature
- Only marine fish "drink"
- Analogous structures: structures in different species having similar or corresponding function but not from the same evolutionary origin
- Homologous structures: structures derived from a common ancestor or same evolutionary or developmental origin
- "Aspect" is the direction that a slope faces

### Population growth

r: rate of natural increase  
k: carrying capcity of a population

## Exam 2

- Morphological Species Concept: subjective, classified by appearance
- Ecological Species Concept: filling a niche.
- Phylogenetic Species Concept: Smallest group of individuals with a common ancestor
- Sympatric speciation: new species evolve from a single ancestral species while inhabiting the same geographic region
- Order of events that may have led to an abiotic origin of living organisms
	1. Formation of organic molecules from inorganic precursors
	2. Formation of macromolecules
	3. Formation of self-replicating molecules
- Eucaryota contain nuclei
- Punctuated equilibrium: evolutionary change happens in rapid bursts
- RNA can:
	- Self-replicate
	- Have catalytic activity like an enzyme
- The theory of endosymbiosis has been proposed to explain how some organelles came to exist in eukaryotes


### Hardy-Weinberg example

| Genotype | # |  
|--------|-----|
| 100/100 | 65 |
| 100/200|35 |
|200/200|50|

p = feq of 100 = ((65 * 2) + 35) / 300 = .55  
q = freq of 200 = ((50 * 2) + 35) / 300 = .45

Expected frequencies:

100/100 = p^2 = 0.303  
100/200 = 2pq = 2(.55)(.45) = .495  
200/200 = q^2 = .2025 = .203

Expected numbers:

100/100 = 0.303 * 150 = 45.45  
100/200 = .495 * 150 = 74.25  
200/200 = .203 * 150 = 30.45

## Post-exam 2

### Plants

- Bryophytes:
	- **Types of plants**:
		- Liverworts
		- Hornworts
		- Mosses
	- Non-vascular
	- Have flagellated sperm (Require water for fertilization as a result)
	- Haploid gametophyte is the dominant life stage
	- Have macrophylls (small, simple leaves on some ferns)
	- Seedless
- Bryophytes produce sporangia which have the advantages of:
	- Tolerant dessication (they can survive in arid periods)
	- Allow dispersal to new environments
- Angiosperms:
	- Monocots
	- Eudicots
- Fungi:
	- Have the **mycota** and **mycetes** suffix sometimes (usually) 
- Heterosporous: produce two types of spores (micro/macro)
- Gynosperms and agiosperms are heterosporous
- Angiosperms flower
- Gynosperms/angiosperms produce seeds and gametophyte are typically microscopic
- Pteridophytes, gynosperms, angiosperms all are sporophyte dominant and have vascular tissue
- Seed plant lifecycle: sporophyte leads to meiosis, megametophyte produces egs while the microgametophyte proces sperm, fertilization occurs, go back to sporphyte
- Seed/sporophyte are diploid (2n), sperm/eggs/megaspores/microspores are haploid (1n).

**BEGIN CHEATSHEET**
-----------------------------

Plant structures:

- Gametangia
- Archigonium
- Antherdium
- Apical meristerms
- Gametophyte
- Sporophyte
- Microphylls and megaphylls
- Xylem and phloem
- Microspores and megaspores
- Microgametophytes
- Seeds

Fungi structures:

- Hyphae or Mycelia
- Sporocarp
- Mycorrhizal fungi
- Flagellated zoospores

Asexual reproduction:

- Germination, Mycelium, Spore-producing structures, spores, repeat

Sexual reproduction:

Heterokaryotic stage, Karyogamy, Zygote, Meiosis, Spore-producing structures, spores, germination

Processes:

- Haploid (n) will be where stuff splits off in two
- Diploid (2n) will be where there's one line
- Meiosis is where the egg thing splits apart looking like it's about to release the kraken, fertilization is where the egg is in the thing and changes colors

Seed plants:

- Microspores
	- Pollen grain = microgametophyte + pollen wall
- Megaspores
	- Ovule = megasporangia + megaspore + integument
 
### Animals

- Metazoa (all animals)
- Porifera (sponges):
	- Lack of specialized tissues
	- Asymmetric
- Ctneophora and Cnideria (comb jellies/jellies)
	- Specialized tissues present
	- Radially symmetric
- Lophotrochozoa:
	- Most bilaterally symmetric
	- Two discrete groups joined based on molecular evidence
	- One group has a lophophore (crown of cilia used in feeding)
	- Other group has a distinctive developmental stage, **trochophore larave**
	- Some members of the group lack both of this distinctive features
	- Phylum Platyhelminthe (flatworms)
		- Acoelomate
		- Gas exchange and elimination of wastes by diffusion
		- Most with single opening associated with gastrovascular system
		- Free living and parasitic forms
	- Phylum Mollusca (snails, slugs, oysters, claims, octopuses, and squids)
		- Simple nervous system present
		- Body has three main parts
			1. Muscular foot used for movement
			2. Visceral mass with internal organs
			3. Mantle that secretes shell
		- Cephalopods (octopuses and squids) have a closed circulatory system
	- Phylum Annelida (segmented worms)
		- Digestive system with mouth and anus
		- Closed circulatory system
		- Simple nervous system with simple "brain"
- Ecdysozoans:
	- Most posess a tough outer covering or cuticle which they shed as they grow (molting is called ecdysis)
	- Phylum Nematoda (round worms)
		- Widespread in water, soils, plant tissues, animal tissues
		- Extremely abundant

		- Unique water vascular system
	- Phylum Chordata (chordates: fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals)
